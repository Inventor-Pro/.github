## 📌 Overview  

**Autodesk Inventor Pro** is a powerful **CAD (computer-aided design)** software suite tailored for **mechanical engineering, industrial design, and manufacturing workflows**. It allows professionals to craft complex 3D models, simulate mechanical behavior, and produce accurate documentation before moving to production.  

Its feature set covers **parametric modeling**, **assembly design**, and **sheet metal fabrication**, offering robust tools for everything from small parts to sophisticated machinery. Built-in **simulation and stress analysis** functions let engineers test their concepts virtually, reducing the need for physical prototypes.  

Thanks to **AnyCAD technology**, Inventor Pro seamlessly handles data from other CAD systems and integrates tightly with **Autodesk VRED**, **Fusion 360**, and the wider Autodesk ecosystem.
